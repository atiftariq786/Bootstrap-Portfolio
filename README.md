## Getting Started

* Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

..* A navbar

..* A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

*  eg. On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, you    should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on        your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

* Responsive images
